# a guide to run public lavalink

First of all thankyou for considering running a public lavalink server!
If you want to run public lavalink, theres a few things to keep in mind.

- **use [cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) when viable**. This is so that your lavalink doesn't get ddosed / spammed till it dies.
- Use tunnelbroker! This is so that your lavalink dont get ratelimited by youtube.
- Install Fail2Ban on the server! It's recommended because it helps you prevent people from making your lavalink overloaded by sending false request.
